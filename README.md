# Capstone-project
Exercise 1: Network Diagram and Critical Path Analysis

Context:
You are managing a mobile app development project. The project consists of several key activities that need to be completed. Some tasks can be done simultaneously (in parallel), while others must be done sequentially. Your task is to create a network diagram for the project and determine the critical path.

Project Activities:

    Market Research (A): 10 days
    Requirement Analysis (B): 5 days, follows A
    UI/UX Design (C): 15 days, follows B
    Backend Development (D): 20 days, can start after A is completed
    Database Setup (E): 10 days, can start after B is completed
    API Integration (F): 10 days, follows D and E
    Frontend Development (G): 25 days, follows C
    Testing Phase 1 (H): 5 days, follows F and G
    User Acceptance Testing (I): 10 days, follows H
    Final Revision (J): 5 days, follows I
    Launch Preparation (K): 5 days, follows J
    App Launch (L): 1 day, follows K

Assumptions:

    All activities start the next day after the completion of their predecessor(s).
    Weekends are not included in the schedule; only workdays are counted.

Exercise Tasks:

    Draw the network diagram for this project.
    Calculate the earliest start (ES), earliest finish (EF), latest start (LS), and latest finish (LF) for each activity.
    Identify all paths through the network diagram.
    Determine the critical path and its duration.
    Highlight any float/slack time available for non-critical activities.

Exercise 2: Gantt Chart

    Based on the WBS from Module 2, create a Gantt Chart for the Capstone Project with a resource of your team (3 people). Use the template provided in Intro page, or use your own.
    Estimating the time needed for each task in your Gantt Chart. Using Planning Poker to do the group estimation here.
    What is the length of the critical path of this Capstone Project?

Exercise 3: Time control

    What can be a potential cause for delay when your team executes the Capstone Project? Draw an ishikawa diagram to visualize these causes
    What are your measure against these risks?
